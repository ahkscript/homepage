		<h1>The AutoHotkey Foundation</h1>
		
		<h2>The Name</h2>
		<p>
			The name <q>AutoHotkey Foundation LLC</q> comes directly from the name of the software <q>AutoHotkey</q>. It is a non-profit LLC (Limited Liability Company) founded for this software.<br>Here is the <a href="https://autohotkey.com/certificate_of_organization.pdf">Certificate of Organization</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
		<p>
			The <q>AutoHotkey Foundation LLC</q> was founded on April 24<sup>th</sup> 2014 in Indiana, USA. It was created in order to prevent monetization, ensure the continuing existence of the software <q>AutoHotkey</q> and naturally, continue the support for it. This foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for this software. It is a volunteer organization created <q>by the community, for the community</q>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Who manages it?</h2>
		<p>
			The foundation's managers are Charlie Simmons (tank), Steve Gray (Lexikos) and Joachim de Fourestier (joedf) with guidance from Chris Mallett (the creator of the software <q>AutoHotkey</q>).
		</p>

		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>
			The tenets of this project will not change. We have and will continue to filter obvious wrongdoing. That said, we are not to be held responsible for any misuse. We shall not be financially liable for any misdeed. An LLC also serves to separate person from entity. Consider the following example: violating a license is not a criminal matter but there could be legal concerns if we appeared to have supported it. As such, the AutoHotkey Foundation LLC is not to be held responsible for any misuse of this product.
			<br><br>
			Many users were unhappy with the forum software changes and site administration policies, and when these opinions were voiced, entire threads were deleted as well as moderators were getting stripped of their privileges. Finally, we came here (ahkscript.org) and contacted Chris for his approval of creating a foundation. Here is a quote:
			
			<div class="quote">
				Having a real organization, especially a legal entity, would be quite an achievement. I'm glad you've done some preliminary research into it because it's far beyond anything I have any knowledge of. My response to your proposal is that as long as I wouldn't be responsible for the legal aspects or any other part of maintaining the organization (keeping it going), I wouldn't mind having some kind of guiding/suggesting position just the way you described, with some emergency authority in case things ever departed radically from the original spirit of the project (such as moving toward commercialization or bundling third-party, disreputable software with AutoHotkey).
			</div>
			<br>
			We want a free and open, unaffiliated community that is transparent and respectful to all fellow users and developers. Here is our mission statement:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Provide highly useful Open Source Software (OSS) free of charge at the foundation owned domain.</li>
				<li>Support the Software</li>
				<li>Keep it Open Source</li>
				<li>Not monetize the software or support site.</li>
				<li>Have more than one person that can make changes to the site</li>
				<li>Offer a web site to support the scripting software for windows
					<ul>
						<li>A support forum suitable to the sharing of knowledge for a scripting community.</li>
						<li>Administration without monopoly</li>
						<li>Solicits content improvements from the community</li>
						<li>Hosts documentation that is freely available</li>
						<li>Protects the community from SPAM, violent, derogatory, or any other	abusive content.</li>
						<li>Transparently identifies Moderators and Site Administrators</li>
						<li>Supports users of multiple preferred languages when the user base is large enough to support it and adequate moderators are available.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Contributions</h2>
